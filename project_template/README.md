# The Coof 
We are going to create a game called “The Coof,” inspired by the Chrome dinosaur game.
It is an arcade game where you control a character on the screen to dodge (jump/duck)
viruses. The goal is to dodge as much viruses as possible.

## Getting Started
---
Run from __main__.py file.

## Project Structure

The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```
root                    (project root folder)
+-- docs                (project documentation)
+-- rename              [src code files - rename for project]
  +-- assets            (program asset files)
  +-- data              (program data files)
  +-- __init__.py       (python package file)
  +-- __main__.py       (entry point for program)
